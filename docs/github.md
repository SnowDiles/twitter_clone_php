# Github Documentation

## Branch creation

Each branch needs to include a definition: `feat/fix/refactor` followed by a `/` and then the description of the branch. Example:

`feat/login-page-creation`

## Commit naming

Each commit need to be written in english.

The commit needs to include the definition of the branch, and have a precise message on what has been done, all lower case.

Example:

`[fix] fixed issues with the forgot password button in the login page`

## Github project

We are using GitHub Projects to follow each task.

If you want to add a new task, you will first need to ask the PO(Product owner) whether the task can be added and then he will do the next steps.
