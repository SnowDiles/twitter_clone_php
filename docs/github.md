### Commit naming :

Each commit need to be written in english.

the commit need to include the definition of the branch, and have a precised message on what have been done.

### Github project :

We are using github project to follow each task.

If you want to add a new task, you will first need to ask the PO(Product owner) if the task can be added and then he will do the next steps.
